    "The focus of the analysis is on how the education level of the adult population (16+) in Barcelona has evolved over time and across space by gender, and how this evolution is reflected in the different neighbourhoods of the city. More concretely, we investigate how average education levels for men and women changed between 2000 and 2025 (using data at five-year intervals), whether there are differences between genders, how these levels and their changes are distributed across census sections, and what main types of neighbourhoods emerge when classifying sections by level and change in education.\n",
    "\n",
    "We used two datasets in this study. From the Barcelona City Council open data services ([Open Data BCN](https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/en/dataset/pad_mdbas_niv-educa-esta_sexe)), we retrieved data on the population of Barcelona aged 16 and over, aggregated by level of education and sex according to the Municipal Register of Inhabitants, at census-section level and administrative units of the city ([BarcelonaCiutat](https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/ca/dataset/20170706-districtes-barris/resource/e16856a7-b3c0-4c32-a468-cc190cbbf7a9)). This structure allows us to link the data to the corresponding geometries. From available data since 1997 we took six time points (2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2020 and 2025), which allows us to construct a longitudinal view of educational change at a fine spatial scale. Each record is georeferenced through official census section identifiers that are consistent with the city’s spatial zoning, enabling the integration of the socio-economic information with detailed geographic boundary data for mapping and spatial analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the analysis, we applied several preprocessing steps. For each census section and year, we computed a weighted average education level separately for females and males; we then took the mean across all sections to obtain a single city-wide value for each year and sex.\n"

    "The two trajectories show that the education level has changed substantially over the 25-year period, and that this change has been broadly similar for both genders. Both series follow a clear upward path, indicating that the average level of education in the adult population has increased over time. Given that the education scale ranges from 1 (lowest) to 6 (highest)(based on the assumption), a city-wide average of around 3.9 in 2025 indicates that Barcelona’s adult population has, on average, moved into the upper half of the education distribution, although it is still some distance from the highest possible level. The key result is the strong improvement from just above 3.0 in 2000 to nearly 3.9 in 2025. Differences between the male and female lines are relatively modest, suggesting that changes in education are not driven exclusively by one gender. Men start at a slightly higher level than women and maintain a small advantage up to around 2020, but the gap gradually narrows. By 2025, the female and male series almost converge at the top of the range, suggesting that not only has the overall education level improved, but gender differences in education have also diminished over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "These aggregate trends are consistent with other recent evidence on the education system in Catalonia and Barcelona. Access to education beyond compulsory secondary school, particularly vocational and training cycles, has expanded, while early school dropout has fallen to 14.8% among 16–24-year-olds in Catalonia and 7.7% in Barcelona(Ajuntament de Barcelona, 2025). At the same time, the number of students repeating school years has decreased and graduation rates from compulsory secondary education (ESO) have increased. Implemented school segregation policies contributed to the drop in segregation. Together, these developments help explain the sustained rise in the average education level captured in our data."

    "The maps reveal a clear spatial structure in education. Rather than being randomly scattered, higher and lower average education levels tend to cluster in particular parts of the city. Some areas, possibly those closer to major universities and high-amenity neighbourhoods, display consistently higher average levels for both women and men across the entire period, while others remain persistently lower. People with higher education are more likely to choose to live in these high-education areas, and their choices are mediated by the housing market, dwelling quality, local amenities and school quality; however, this mechanism would need to be confirmed with supplementary data. Visually, the pattern for women and men is broadly similar, although local differences appear in some neighbourhoods where one gender slightly outperforms the other. Overall, these maps make visible the spatial inequalities in education that underlie the aggregate time series: even though the city as a whole has improved, not all census sections share the same starting point or long-run position."

    "The maps show that the dynamics of change are far from spatially uniform. Most census sections register positive growth in education, but the magnitude of this growth varies substantially across the city. Some areas, particularly in parts of the coastal and peripheral districts, exhibit very large relative increases (the green tones), while others experience more moderate gains or almost no change (orange and red tones). These strong percentage increases often occur in sections that started from relatively low education levels in 2000, so even a moderate absolute improvement translates into a large relative change. They may also reflect neighbourhoods that have undergone urban renewal, especially the Sant Martí district, shown in dark green in the figure, which has experienced substantial regeneration since 2000, or that have attracted new, more highly educated residents over the period, for example through regeneration projects, changes in the housing market, or improved transport connections. By contrast, several central or already highly educated areas show smaller percentage increases, consistent with having less “room” for further gains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing the female and male maps suggests that, in most places, improvements have been broadly shared across genders: sections with strong increases for women typically also show strong increases for men. Nonetheless, there are local pockets where the change is slightly stronger for one gender, hinting at subtle differences in how educational expansion has affected women and men. Taken together with the level maps, these results indicate that some neighbourhoods are both highly educated and improving, while others remain doubly disadvantaged, combining lower starting levels with weaker growth.\n"

We first defined a spatial neighborhood structure using queen contiguity, where two census sections are considered neighbors if they share any part of their boundary (edge or corner). This produces a spatial weights matrix that encodes who is “close to whom”. After row-standardizing this matrix (so each row sums to one), we applied esda.Moran_Local separately to the female and male overall averages (shown in Figure 4). Using a 5% significance threshold, we grouped each section into one of five cluster types: High–High (high education surrounded by high), Low–Low (low surrounded by low), High–Low, Low–High, or Insignificant (no significant local pattern)."

    "The maps confirm that educational levels are strongly clustered in Barcelona. High-education clusters (red) dominate much of the western and south-western parts of the city and appear in a few additional pockets, indicating large contiguous areas of advantage. In contrast, low-education clusters (dark blue) are mainly concentrated in the northern and north-eastern periphery (including the port area), where educational disadvantage is more persistent. A smaller number of sections fall into the mixed categories (yellow and light blue), marking sharp local contrasts along the boundaries between these high- and low-education zones, while grey areas show no clear local pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the patterns for women and men are broadly similar: the main High–High and Low–Low regions overlap for both sexes, indicating that the spatial processes shaping education, such as residential sorting, housing markets or school catchment areas, tend to affect women and men simultaneously. There are, however, some local differences in cluster type, especially along certain boundaries between advantaged and disadvantaged areas, suggesting that gendered dynamics may play a role in a few specific neighborhoods. Together, these results show a strong degree of spatial autocorrelation in education: where people live in Barcelona is closely related to the long-run education level of both women and men in their census section and its neighbors.\n"

    "To move from continuous indicators to a more interpretable typology of neighbourhoods, we created a classification of Barcelona’s census sections based on their educational characteristics. Specifically, we focused on four features: the overall average education for women and men, and the percentage change in average education between 2000 and 2025 for women and men. Before clustering, we standardized these variables to have mean zero and unit variance, so that no single indicator dominated the solution purely because of its scale. We then applied k-means clustering with four clusters (identified based on elbow method) to the standardized feature matrix, using each census section as an observation. The resulting cluster labels were joined back to the GeoDataFrame and mapped in Figure 5. \n"

    "Inspecting the cluster-wise averages of the four input variables reveals clear differences across groups. “Established high-education areas” contain census sections with the highest overall education levels for both women and men (around 4.0 and 4.2 on a 1–6 scale) and only modest percentage gains over time; these neighbourhoods are already highly educated and are consolidating their position. “Lower-education, slowly improving areas” combine the lowest overall education (around 3.0–3.1) with only moderate growth, representing sections that remain clearly below the city average despite some improvement. “Improving from mid level” areas have medium education levels (around 3.3–3.4) but the strongest percentage increases, especially for women (over 50% on average), resembling upgrading neighbourhoods that are catching up from a lower starting point. Finally, “Moderate, steadily improving areas”, the largest group, occupy an intermediate position, with moderate levels (around 3.5–3.7) and moderate changes, and can be seen as stable middle-range sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main types of neighborhoods we identify are therefore distinguished by two key characteristics: their long-run educational position (higher vs lower average education) and their educational trajectory over the period (faster vs slower improvement), with gender differences implicitly taken into account through the inclusion of both male and female indicators. If this classification were to be used to target areas in most need, the natural priority would be the “Lower-education, slowly improving areas”, since these neighborhoods both lag behind the city and show limited signs of catching up. A secondary priority could be the “Improving from mid level” cluster, where education levels are still moderate but improvements are strong, and where additional support might consolidate and accelerate ongoing progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "In spatial terms, “Established high-education areas” tend to concentrate in particular parts of Barcelona, while “Lower-education, slowly improving areas” form more continuous zones elsewhere. “Improving from mid level” neighbourhoods often appear adjacent to more advantaged zones, suggesting possible spillovers or diffusion of educational gains across local boundaries. The resulting classification therefore not only summarizes complex temporal and gendered dynamics into a small number of meaningful types, but also highlights how educational inequality and change are organized in space across Barcelona’s urban fabric.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the analysis shows that education levels in Barcelona have risen substantially for both women and men since 2000, but clear spatial and neighbourhood-level inequalities remain in both the level of education and the pace of improvement. As a natural next step, it would be important to examine how these patterns are shaped by the economic background of residents, although doing so would require additional data and further analysis."
